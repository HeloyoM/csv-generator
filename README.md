  This tool is very useful, in my opinion, whether it is to introduce new users to the system,  or new products to the e-commerce system. Someday, you will meet with annoying <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T2/images/I/719IQp4yPuL._SX522_.jpg" width=35 height=35 /> csv files that need to map the data in them and other.

All you have to do is give a name to the csv file that you want to upload as its name in mysql server, and with fast optimization everything is pushed to the database at enormous speed
